# Ruby-Knight-Moves
Finding the shortest path for a knight chess piece to any selected square.

This is my solution to The Odin Project's [Knight's Travails](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-knights-travails) assignment.

I created a lot of code that I ended up not needing for this specific project, although I learned a lot that would help with an actual [chess project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFPWIjDDcPc).

It was fun (and quite difficult) for me to work with a new data structure, I kept thinking in terms of a binary search tree, which resulted in a lot of headaches with figuring out how to print out the path a knight piece was taking (I somehow managed to solve the number of moves quite early on!). Having children nodes point to their parent was the solution I ended up chosing.

I'm sure things can be done a lot cleaner, but overall I'm happy with how I finally solved the assignment.

Here is the [REPL](https://replit.com/@menchx/ruby-knight-moves) for the project.
